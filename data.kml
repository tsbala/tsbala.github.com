We work hard to protect wild plants on the ground and to build understanding of the vital role they play in everyone’s lives.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Wild plants are essential to life – they clean our air and water, provide food and shelter for our insects, birds and animals and are critical in the fight against climate change.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Plantlife carries out practical conservation work across Britain, manages nature reserves, influences policy and legislation, runs events and activities that help people discover wild plants and works with others to promote the conservation of wild plants for the benefit of all.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

In 2010 we will celebrate our 150th anniversary
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Times may have changed but there is still hardship, especially for elderly or disabled people and families who struggle to make a living from the farm.  Each year, RABI makes payments totalling around &amp;#163;2million to help people facing financial difficulties.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
RABI supports elderly farmers and farm workers, and those of any age who are disabled, with regular grants or one-off payments for special items that they are unable to afford themselves.  Around &amp;#163;250,000 each year is paid out for disability aids and essential household appliances.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Working farming families who are facing hardship because of illness, bereavement or some other crisis can receive short-term help.  Just imagine you’re a dairy farmer, with cows to milk two or three times a day, but your young child is seriously ill in hospital.  Paying for help on the farm and even the cost of travel can soon mount up and cause financial difficulties.  That is when RABI can step in.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
When there is a crisis such as major flooding or outbreaks of animal disease, RABI makes emergency payments (over &amp;#163;900,000 in 2007 when there was an outbreak of foot and mouth) to help with domestic expenses.</description><Point><coordinates>51.7524672885835,-1.29280014721747</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>The Rainforest Foundation, UK</name><description>The mission of the Rainforest Foundation is to support indigenous people and traditional populations of the world&amp;#39;s rainforests in their efforts to protect their environment and fulfil their rights to land and livelihood.</description><Point><coordinates>51.5247320794785,-0.0877555114549355</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Wildlife Conservation Research Unit</name><description>WildCRU is Europe’s leading university based conservation research unit.

It is said that prevention is better than cure. That&amp;#39;s why we believe in

campaign to change the systems that perpetuate poverty. We want to
&amp;#39;cure&amp;#39; the lack of healthcare - not just stick a plaster over the

We help to arrest 17 criminals every day and one murderer every 5 days. Our charity runs the anonymous telephone number, 0800 555 111, that people can call to pass on information about crimes. We also have an anonymous online ‘Giving Information’ form that people can fill out to pass on information. Some people fear the consequences of going to the police when they know about a crime. Crimestoppers is there for them. Because the telephone number is anonymous, callers are not asked for any personal information and calls cannot be traced. 0800 555 111 has been helping to find criminals and solve crimes for 21 years. We’ve received more than 1 million telephone calls with useful information about crimes. It’s a system that works for everyone – except criminals. With your support, we can continue fighting crime to make our society a safer place to live.

Shooting Star opened in 2005 and now supports 250 families. The care services are based around the needs of the whole family, so as well as caring for the children and young people, there are activities and support groups for siblings, parents and other relatives. This makes a real difference to families who find themselves in unimaginable circumstances - helping them live life to the full by providing opportunities for fun and laughter, as well as helping them through the tougher times.

Families benefit from Shooting Star&amp;#39;s care services in the community, in their own homes and at Shooting Star House, the purpose-built facility based in Hampton, Middlesex. These services include Short Breaks (respite care), Day Care, Outreach Care, Family Support and Therapies and End of Life Care.

It costs &amp;#163;3.5 million every year (&amp;#163;9,000 a day) to maintain these care services and with no long-term statutory funding, the majority of this comes from voluntary donations.</description><Point><coordinates>51.4243262722366,-0.356891680565632</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Sports Aid Trust</name><description>SportsAid is the charity for sport.

Available anywhere in the UK, 1pm - 11pm every day, we can provide free connections to local or national services, and text information to caller&amp;#39;s mobile phones.  

Get Connected&amp;#39;s vision is that every young person in the UK can find the help they need to support their emotional and physical wellbeing.  

There are 11 million young people in the UK.  In Get Connected&amp;#39;s survey of 2006, 4 out of 5 of young people didn&amp;#39;t know where to turn with their problems.  Get Connected is the free helpline for these young people, who know they need help but don&amp;#39;t know where to find it.  With Helpline Workers trained to support each young person in their unique situation and help them choose the best service from over 13,000 in the UK, Get Connected is the vital gateway between a distressing confusing problem the young person can&amp;#39;t solve on their own and the service that can help them solve it.  Crucially, the connection we make for each young person to their chosen source of help is free as well.

We do this by supporting partner organisations to carry out life changing work with them.  We think disabled children and disabled young people should be allowed to decide what changes they would like to see, so we make sure that the organisations which we work with actively involve disabled children and young people in their decision making.  We have been working in East Africa for the past twenty years and during that time have affected the lives of over 250,000 disabled children and young people.  We are currently working in Uganda and Kenya and hope to expand our work to other African countries in the future.  The programmes we run include rehabilitative healthcare, inclusive education, parents support groups, children&amp;#39;s after school clubs and campaigning work which seeks the full inclusion of disabled children and disabled young people in policy and practice everywhere we work.

The approach of the Orangutan Foundation goes beyond that of purely
protecting the orangutan. Critically it also includes a recognition that
orangutan habitat is unique in it&amp;#39;s richness of biodiversity and crucial for
local communities, who are as dependant on the forest as is the orangutan.

Conservation is more than protecting a species, it is about saving nature
which includes us, &amp;#39;the fifth ape&amp;#39;. The efforts of all of us to prevent
global warming will be seen as a defining moment in history, for humanity&amp;#39;s
sake and for the health of the whole planet. Tropical forests can play a

Parents of children with autism are told that education is the only thing proven to unlock the potential of their children, offering them a better future. However there is a dire lack of both professionals with autism-specific training and specialist school places.

It’s not surprising then that from time to time both they and their families need a break.  Cherry Trees is that special place, providing professional care in a safe and loving environment, where every child is valued for who they are.

It was established in 1904 and has a worldwide reputation for the quality of its training. It runs an ongoing fundraising appeal to Trusts, Foundations and philanthropic individuals in order to provide awards for students who need additional financial assistance in order to complete the training on the full time courses. Students work in excess of 36 hours per week which precludes their undertaking regular part time employment to supplement their income during term time. Students who are relocating to London are in a particularly vulnerable financial position as the full student loan does not cover the real costs of living in London. So too are students with a first degree who are ineligible for loans to pay the mandatory student fee or their term time living costs.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
All donations made to the Student Scholarship/Bursary fund at RADA are allocated to students in genuine financial need. Donors should also note that the Gift Aid element of any donation paid through an appeal page for an individual RADA student is paid to the Academy&amp;#39;s Student Hardship Fund from which any student applying for financial support through the Academy may benefit. In this way, sponsors donating through JustGiving by supporting an individual RADA student, also indirectly assist all other RADA students who apply for support through the Academy Student Hardship Fund.</description><Point><coordinates>51.5212300761644,-0.129926116343755</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>The Children's Foundation</name><description>The Children&amp;#39;s Foundation raises essential funds for medical and lifestyle research to combat childhood diseases and conditions such as cerebral palsy and autism.

We do this by providing training, livestock, seeds and ongoing support; and by helping families make the most of the land and resources they already have.

As a result, families are happier and healthier, children are educated, homes are improved.

In turn, these families then pass on young livestock, seeds or training to others. And so on. And so on.
This ‘pass on’ principle not only builds stronger communities, it allows us to help even more people to develop skills, confidence and self respect.

The ‘can do will do’ attitude of Send a Cow is born out of our faming roots and our Christian faith.
Working hand in hand with African farmers for over 20 years, we prove that farming in Africa works.</description><Point><coordinates>51.3803105847817,-2.43128384928542</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield Hospital Charitable Fund</name><description>The Royal Brompton &amp;amp; Harefield NHS Trust is the largest specialist heart and lung centre in the UK, treating patients from across the country.

Founded in 1969 in response to the secret genocide of Amazonian
Indians, Survival is the only international organization supporting
tribal peoples worldwide. We do not accept funding from any national
government.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Today, Survival has supporters in 82 countries. We work for tribal
peoples’ rights in three complementary ways: education, advocacy and
campaigns. We also offer tribal people themselves a platform to
address the world. We work closely with local indigenous
organizations, and focus on tribal peoples who have the most to lose,
usually those most recently in contact with the outside world.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
We believe that public opinion is the most effective force for
change. Its power will make it harder, and eventually impossible, for
governments and companies to oppress tribal peoples.

The Fire Fighters Charity is here for fire fighters during their times of need. The Charity offers vital support services across the UK for all fire fighters, assisting in excess of 17,500 individuals every year.

Our modern, dynamic and award-winning charity has three UK centres, located in Cumbria, Devon and West Sussex, which provide therapy, rehabilitation and recuperation facilities. Our pioneering Beneficiary Support Services offers local and remote assistance to fire service personnel in need nationwide – providing solutions to real life problems.

It costs over &amp;#163;9 million every year to keep the Charity running, and with no government funding, we are completely reliant upon donations and fundraising, so your support is very much needed.

CNYTrust manages and funds its own school in Hebei, China providing funding, educational resources and management advice.

As a non-profit organisation our work is heavily dependent on volunteers and donations. Trustees and volunteers work for CNYTrust in their spare time and are not paid, so every donation goes directly towards helping another student get to school.

All donations received by CNYTrust are used either in our CNYTrust sponsor a child scholarship fund or put towards the maintenance or development of the CNYTrust school. We would like to take this opportunity to thank you in advance both on behalf of the Trustees and children who we are supporting for making a donation.

Together is a national charity working alongside people with mental health issues on their journey to leading fulfilling and independent lives. We aspire to a world where each individual can play their part in breaking down the barriers that exist around mental health through ignorance and lack of understanding. We believe that people with mental health issues benefit from leading their own lives and shaping the services they receive.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
We promote our conviction that the best mental health services are delivered in partnership with the people we work alongside.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

By working intensively with each and every person, focusing on their hopes and needs, we can support them in building a positive and meaningful future for themselves - however long it takes.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Who we are:&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Today we work with around 4,000 adults a month, the majority of whom are building a positive future for themselves whilst living with complex and recurring mental health issues. Together has around 100 different projects providing a variety of services.  We support people on their own journey towards mental wellbeing - helping them with aspects of life getting a place to live, finding work, making friends, building self-esteem and playing an active role in their community. Together does this through providing a range of services to meet the different needs of people with mental health issues.

National Eisteddfod of Wales
The National Eisteddfod of Wales is one of the great festivals of the world, attracting over 160,000 visitors every year.  An eclectic mixture of culture, music, visual arts and all kinds of activities for people of all ages, there’s something for everyone on the festival field (called the “Maes” in Welsh ) during the first week of August every year.
The Eisteddfod is a travelling festival which belongs to the people of Wales – wherever they live, and this is an integral part of its appeal. The festival visits areas in north and south Wales alternately, and hosting the National Eisteddfod is a great boost for any area.

Many people from near and far come in a constant stream to Mirfield for spiritual refreshment, experience of monastic life and worship and for Christian education and formation. Sometimes we can hardly cope with the numbers. We find ourselves offering space and resources for women and men who seek encouragement, stillness and space to pray in the midst of stressful lives. At the heart of it all, our church is our place of worship and home for many other events. It is now in need of major refurbishment: structural repairs, a new heating system, rewiring, new lighting and sound systems, a new floor, redecoration and much-needed disabled access. If all our activities here are to flourish, we need a church able to meet the needs of today. We need your help to safeguard what makes this place special and to create a church that can serve and sustain its many users for another century.

Since 2004 Take Heart has built an English language and IT school that has provided real job opportunities to over 1000 students.

a centre of musical excellence and a site of extraordinary historical significance.

Our work is mainly funded by government; however, there are always funding gaps and a growing shortfall, which makes it difficult to provide the “added extras” which maximise the effectiveness of the housing and support we provide, such as move-on grants for residents to help them move-on successfully to more independent accommodation (funding such items as cookers, fridges, carpeting or furniture).

We support homeless people, lone-parent families with domestic violence issues, people with mental health problems, older people, people with physical disabilities, people with learning disabilities and those recovering from drug/alcohol dependency.

We help over 1,000 people and families every year and has helped over 15,000 since 1972.

all patients should be entitled to the very best care available. St Luke&amp;#180;s has
been providing specialist palliative medical and nursing care, free of charge,
to patients from Plymouth, South West Devon and East Cornwall for more
than twenty-five years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A registered charity, we are passionate about offering our patients dignity
and choice at a time in their lives when they may feel they have none. Our
vision is to provide the best end of life care to all patients wherever their
`preferred place of care&amp;#180; might be - Hospice, Hospital or Home. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The St Luke&amp;#180;s network of care stretches far beyond the walls of the Hospice
inpatient unit at Turnchapel, Plymouth reaching out to more than 2,000
patients each year. Alongside the specialist medical and nursing care,
patients are also offered practical, financial, emotional and spiritual support. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Government funding covers less than 30% of the cost of caring for
inpatients. We therefore have to raise at least &amp;#163;3.5 million from the local
community every year so the fundraising never stops! That is why your
donation and support is so important. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description><Point><coordinates>50.355233587499,-4.1193539100874</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Disability Law Service</name><description>The Disability Law Service is a national registered charity that provides confidential and free legal advice for disabled adults, their families and carers.

foster care. On any one day over 51,000 children in the UK are looked
after by foster carers as they are unable to stay with their own
parents. Many have been abused or neglected. They may have a disability
which their parents struggle to cope with or their family may be under
severe strain. Foster care provides these vulnerable children with the
support and stability they need, helping to ensure that their traumatic
start in life does not lead to problems in adulthood. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

We provide training, advice, information and support, and make sure the
views of children and young people are heard and respected throughout
the care system. We are instrumental in recruiting foster carers, and
helping to tackle the deficit of around 10,000 foster carers still
needed to look after vulnerable children. Our media campaigns have
reached audiences of 30 million, raising public awareness and ensuring
action at the highest levels.</description><Point><coordinates>51.5026477906873,-0.103508782878436</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Nordoff Robbins (UK)</name><description>Play, dance or sing - everyone responds to music. Music has a unique

Originally set up in 1987 to fund local cancer research, the Charity has expanded to serve the rapidly changing world of cancer services at a local level.  Why local?  Simply because anyone diagnosed with cancer deserves the best possible treatment and professional support close to home. 

 

In September 2004 we opened a purpose built cancer support centre in the grounds of the RD&amp;amp;E Hospital. The Centre is open five days a week and offers a whole range of non-clinical cancer support services.  The aim of these services is to ensure that patients and families are never without good support and information from the time of diagnosis.  

 

Despite moving into supportive care, research remains a very important part of our work. FORCE funded research is currently focussed on lung and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, FORCE has also  helped fund a new generation of equipment. Anyone treated for cancer locally is likely to benefit from equipment provided by the Charity at a total cost of over &amp;#163;2 million. To cover the cost of these commitments we need to raise &amp;#163;700,000 p.a., all of which comes from voluntary donations.

We work in communities right across the capital - and at our two outstanding education centres in rural Buckinghamshire and Sussex. We’re here to help young people be the best they can be. 

Our vision is of a great world city in which every young person, whatever their background, is valued and 

challenged to become the best they can be. 

Our mission is to improve services and opportunities for young people.

We want everyone growing up in and around London to enjoy access to high  quality youth work – information, guidance and life enriching activities, as well as someone to talk to – all within a safe, stimulating and supportive environment. We work with young people in all their brilliant diversity, placing a particular emphasis on those 

who might be in any way disadvantaged or at risk of being excluded.

Since our formation we have gone from strength to strength and do a tremendous amount of fund-raising ourselves.
The three main aims of the charity are: -
* To raise funds to help with the provision of items which are not available via the N.H.S and to buy those much needed extras for our patients.
* To give support to the medical staff and patients in any way we can.
* To promote awareness in the local community.
The charity&amp;#39;s costs are minimal and therefore the majority of the funds raised are spent on patient care.

At Children’s Hospice South West we help and support children and their families who are living with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions and we are the only organisation in the South West to provide vital hospice care to these families. Some families come to us for palliative care, some for emergency care and many for planned respite and a rare opportunity for a break away. But there’s more to it than that. We provide a loving and caring place for every member of the families who stay with us. A place where everyone can begin to forget their worries for a while, be a family again and find expert help and support in facing an uncertain future.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Our services are free to the families who need us because we believe that nothing should get in the way of very sick children receiving the very best care. So, with little government funding, we rely on the generosity of our supporters to deliver our promise to ‘make the most of short and precious lives’.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Children’s Hospice South West has two purpose-built hospices in the South West. Little Bridge House in North Devon and Charlton Farm in North Somerset. A third special home from home for life-limited children in Cornwall and Plymouth, is due to open in 2011 called Little Harbour.

At PACE children with physical

active members of society. Cerebral palsy is a physical condition
affecting movement as a result of damage to the brain. We believe in
each child&amp;#39;s ability to learn despite their disability. We provide a
loving and inspirational environment, motivating children with physical
disabilities to work hard at achieving their goals. Our focus is on
&amp;#39;educating for life&amp;#39; - developing a child&amp;#39;s social, emotional,
communication, academic and motor skills. Every child&amp;#39;s achievement is a
direct result of our unique staff team, all working together in one
centre with the child at its heart. PACE is a charity inspired by the
principles of Conductive Education, a system which emphasises that
children develop as a whole. One in every 400 children in the UK is
affected by cerebral palsy. Your support enables us to reach children
and families though intensive programmes, training and outreach. We
depend on donations from trusts, businesses, groups and individuals.</description><Point><coordinates>51.8254435939322,-0.826591183299436</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>British Tinnitus Association</name><description>The British Tinnitus Association helps people with tinnitus.

The Trust exists to celebrate the life of William Wates (1977- 1996) who was tragically killed when travelling in South America.

We are delighted to announce that the Trust has now donated just over &amp;#163;1M and helped over 8,000 disadvantaged young people fulfil their potential.

However, the success of the tour came at high cost and nine men were killed and 58 were wounded in action. 

Now the Regiment is to build a Memorial at the Imperial War Museum&amp;#39;s site at Duxford, co-locating it with the Regimental Museum, to commemorate all 69 of the its soldiers who have died on duty since it was raised as the Army’s first Large Regiment.

The Regimental Memorial is to cost some &amp;#163;150,000. In parallel with this the Museum has to improve and update its displays in order to accommodate the weapons and artifacts brought back from Afghanistan and from future operational tours.  The total cost of the Museum enhancements is &amp;#163;210,000, making a combined target of &amp;#163;360,000.

Your donation will count.  Thank you.

Our work is based at the regional children’s cancer and leukemia unit in Leeds, which is due to move from St James’ Hospital to Leeds General Infirmary in 2010.

As Candlelighters was founded by, and is still run by, parents of children who have or have had cancer, and the medical staff who treat them, we understand the trauma and the turmoil of that diagnosis.

We can only continue to make a difference with the help of our supporters.  Together we CAN fight children’s cancer.

The children &amp;amp; families we work with come from backgrounds of abject poverty, family breakdown, abandonment, &amp;amp; abuse. They are often forced to live on the streets, working &amp;amp; begging, in conflict with local residents &amp;amp; the police. Many resort to substance abuse as a means of escaping cold &amp;amp; hunger. We believe that these children have the capacity &amp;amp; desire to transform their lives, &amp;amp; AfCiC operates several programmes designed to help them do so:
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Outreach Programmes for Vulnerable Children prevent children from ever going to the street &amp;amp; rehabilitate those who are already there. Some projects include school drop out prevention, child sponsorship, microfinance &amp;amp; business assistance, outreach clinics for street children, &amp;amp; after school children’s clubs.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
A residential Interim Care Centre for street children, carrying out non-formal education, rehabilitation, counselling &amp;amp; family reintegration work.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Kenyan Children’s Legal Aid Work provides free legal advice to children &amp;amp; their guardians.

All children have Wishes but for these children and their families that Wish is so much more precious and for the duration of their Wish, these children are able to forget about hospital routines, doctors, gruelling treatments and have the chance to smile, laugh and enjoy life like any other child.

Wishes are varied and far reaching. For some it is a trip to Disneyland in Florida or Paris to meet their favourite characters and for others it is the chance to get up close to a favourite pop star of sporting hero. Some children just want books or toys, whilst others want a computer to catch up on school work or keep in touch with their friends. Whatever the Wish, wherever possible, When You Wish Upon a Star will aim to make that Wish come true.</description><Point><coordinates>52.980380513382,-1.17165277347928</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>West Middlesex University Hospital Charitable Fund</name><description>West Middlesex University Hospital is a major acute hospital in Isleworth, West London, providing a full range of hospital services to residents of the London Boroughs of Hounslow, Richmond and Twickenham.

And we want every young person with cancer in this country to have that chance.</description><Point><coordinates>51.5156918279875,-0.133425115287431</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>The Dystonia Society</name><description>The Dystonia Society provides practical and emotional support to people living with this neurological condition by providing support and information services both nationally through our Helpline and at local level through our network of branches.

To see street children realise their potential and discover their worth.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Our Mission Statement:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Through its work Retrak will enable street children in Africa to have a real alternative to life on the street. (Retrak currently has projects in Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya).
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Retrak believes that every child is a unique and valuable gift, and that safe family is the preferred environment for a child to grow up and develop. We believe that the community has a vital role to play in the protection and development of the life of its children.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Retrak’s services for street children include:
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
o Healthcare, refuge, education, employment opportunities and sports.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
o Long term care as they rediscover their identity and purpose.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
o Foster care placements and/or resettlement to their family/community of origin.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
o Supporting the transition into a self sustaining community life.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
o A voice that speaks on their behalf. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description><Point><coordinates>53.3747241819284,-2.185413899187</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Birmingham Conservation Trust</name><description>Birmingham Conservation Trust rescues historic buildings at risk in Birmingham.

Today, with over 4,000 members, the Association sees its purpose as working for the benefit of patients by advancing the science and practice of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery. The BOA believes it has been very successful in this role and the increasing demand is reflected in the fact that, today, 40% of all surgeons in the UK work in Trauma and Orthopaedics.

As well as the human cost of pain and suffering, musculoskeletal disorders are the most common cause of illness in the UK affecting over 8.5 million people and are responsible for in excess of 11 million lost working days at a cost to society, in 2007 prices of over &amp;#163;7 billion. It is the sixth-largest area of NHS expenditure, at over &amp;#163;3.3 billion annually and accounts for over 30% of patients who visit their GPs.

Over the years, through different charitable vehicles, the BOA has granted in excess of &amp;#163;5.7 million to support orthopaedic research. As a charity, it relies on voluntary donations from people such as you. Joint Action has been established by the BOA to help patients by raising funds for research so as to improve orthopaedic treatment for you and future generations.

All services share the common goal of educating, encouraging and promoting a lifestyle of abstinence as well as providing high-quality, accessible services for local people and their families.
We have been providing services for over 17 years and our unique approach owes much to dialogue with past and present users of the service and is always being reviewed to ensure we quickly meet the needs of whoever reaches out for help.

organisation Africa &amp;amp; Asia Venture (&amp;quot;AV&amp;quot;) to help enhance the quality of
school education in the communities served by AV volunteers.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Our fundraising efforts are focused around one project per year in each
country where AV operates. Projects involve providing new or refurbished
school classrooms, libraries, washrooms and kitchens; supplying books,
teaching materials and sports equipment; financing teachers&amp;#39; costs and
training expenses, as well as selectively financing pupil subsidy
schemes or bursaries.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
AV&amp;#39;s strength at grassroots level, with its network of in-country
representatives, enables us to establish genuine community needs,
closely monitor the implementation of projects and ensure that funds are
properly spent. Wherever possible we work with former AV volunteers who
have dedicated time and energy to helping the schools and communities
where they spent time as volunteers.

Woolf Institute aims to make a significant contribution to the
interfaith encounter, which represents one of the most important
challenges to humanity in the 21st century. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

As it enters its second decade, the Institute is seeking funding to
respond to the growing number of requests to deliver educational
programmes which explore faith and interfaith issues in faith
communities, local communities as well as in the workplace. Drawing on
our expertise in research and teaching, The Woolf Institute will develop
a range of short courses and community leadership programmes around the
UK, tailored for those unable to study full-time or afford University fees. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Your support will help us deliver education that will change the way
attitudes towards Jews, Christians and Muslims are communicated in
congregations, communities and in the workplace.</description><Point><coordinates>52.2084369882513,0.122970102031832</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Link Romania</name><description>Link Romania exists to rebuild lives and communities in Eastern Europe.

Architecture and urban design have a huge influence on the quality of our lives. Yet we lack a common language to express our needs and aspirations for the quality of our buildings and public spaces.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Based in London, Open-City is a unique, independent organisation committed to raising the standard of architecture and built environment by opening people&amp;#185;s eyes and minds to good design.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Open-City has a basis of experience, expertise and research built up over a decade and a half. We encourage dialogue, debate and learning about how architecture affects our daily lives, and enable people to discover and understand how they can really influence change in the built environment.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
We play a unique role through campaigning for the independent voice, through reaching across all 33 London boroughs, and through connecting professionals, practitioners, decision-makers and Londoners in general, to generate understanding and new thinking to make the capital a better place in which to live, work, play and learn.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;</description><Point><coordinates>51.5226582596845,-0.0797256754452514</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Crusader Foundation</name><description>In partnership with Coventry Crusaders Basketball Club, the

disadvantage and disability. Our vision is a world in which everyone has
access to eyecare and spectacles.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Vision Aid Overseas develops sustainable eyecare services that ensure an impact for our patients:
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
* We establish International Vision Centres where high quality spectacles can be manufactured and sold at an affordable price following a thorough eye examination.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
* We train healthcare workers in practical eye testing and vision health skills that equips them to work as primary eyecare workers
in their local communities.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
* We utilize the expertise of UK optical professionals who develop outreach services in areas away from existing facilities and who undertake teaching programmes across the developing world.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Our work is focused on improving the lives of people who are marginalised by poor eyesight and motivated by our belief that good vision should be a right for all, not just those who can afford it.</description><Point><coordinates>51.1318752107374,-0.171216839134154</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Games Aid</name><description>GamesAid is a new UK video games industry based charity.

As with all parts of the National Health Service there is never enough money to pay for all aspects of what we technically call ‘specialist palliative care’.

This is where the independent charity Duchess of Kent House Trust comes in.

We raise funds to support local projects who currently help over two hundred children with shelter, food, medical care, education and the love and support they so desperately need. We hope to help many more with your support. 

 

It is hard to understand how these children end up with no-one. Sometimes parents die or are imprisoned or fall ill; sometimes children flee homes due to violence or abuse; sometimes children become part of a gang; there are many reasons. Such children are often viewed at best as a nuisance and at worst as a danger to public safety. Violence against them is common place, and the only way of surviving is through begging, prostitution and crime. 

 

It is the aim of Children of Bahia to help to look after and educate as many children as we can over the coming years, to help guide them into a brighter future full of love and support. 

 

All our UK staff are un-paid volunteers and over 95% of all donations get to Brazil to help the children directly.  Please do support us if you can. www.childrenofbahia.com

fundamental change to the society and economy of one region. By doing this
AfriKids has uncovered the extraordinary passion and ability of the local

Provides sanctuary, care and re-homing for unwanted and lost animals in and around Milton Keynes, Beds, Bucks and Northants.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
HULA Aims:&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
To relieve suffering &amp;amp; distress, by providing refuge and care to animals until suitable permanent adoptions can be found if appropriate.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
To provide help and advice to pet and animal owners or their families, who are unable to cope due to a change in their circumstances.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
HULA takes in unwanted and abandoned pets for re-homing, but also rescues other animals and has goats, pigs, ponies, chickens, ducks, geese, sheep, a donkey and cows. All will stay with HULA for the rest of their lives. All animals are vet checked, most of the cats and dogs are neutered and all are micro-chipped and vaccinated prior to re-homing. HULA never puts any animal to sleep unless medically advised.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Animals come to HULA for a variety of reasons,including domestic break-up, death or infirmity of the owner, hospitalisation, imprisonment, emigration, change of job, moving to new accommodation where pets aren’t allowed and, unfortunately, sometimes they are simply abandoned.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
HULA’s services are increasingly in demand due to local population growth, meaning everyday survival is all too often a daunting challenge. HULA relies solely on the generosity of the public and is grateful for all help received. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

We need your help
As London becomes increasingly more diverse issues of deprivation, isolation and exclusion as well as youth crime blight our communities.  The ongoing work of the Peace Alliance helps to:
- Develop and empower community based peace projects
- Provide a strategic interface with government agendas and senior decision makers
- Support vulnerable victims as well as families of victims of violent crime
- Intervene and act as an adviser in crisis situations

Why not join us and help make a difference.
The Peace Fund will provide the much needed funds to help us continue to support good work across London and other parts of the UK.  Your support will mean that we can reach and support more young people, victims and vulnerable communities.
The Peace Alliance, which began in 2001, has established a successful track record in supporting community cohesion and intervening in crime and community safety situations.  It plays an active role in influencing government policy and seeks to empower local people to affect their communities in a positive manner.

animal health skills and equipment, their animals are healthier,
providing a more reliable source of meat, eggs and dairy products. Not
only does this mean that the community is healthier as they have a
secure source of food, but they are also able to earn an income from the
sale of any excess produce.

Each week another 50 Scots will be diagnosed with the disorder. Epilepsy is a distressing, debilitating condition which in many cases seriously affects quality of life. There are approximately 40,000 people in Scotland living with epilepsy.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
We are currently raising funds for our Valentine Appeal, helping young people with epilepsy. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
St Valentine is the patron saint both of epilepsy and of young people. Our Appeal will encourage teenagers with epilepsy to lead as normal a life as possible by providing the knowledge, skills and positive examples that will help them to cope better with the condition and so integrate better within their peer group.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I feel like this will not only help young people but other ages of people who have epilepsy, and it will help others understand more about living with epilepsy and not just the medical side”, (female, 17). &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are an estimated 8550 children and teenagers with epilepsy in Scotland. The needs of young people are currently somewhat under-represented within the epilepsy community. There is a real need for emotional and social support. Teenagers with epilepsy may experience significant day to day problems that can prevent them from living ordinary lives. In particular, the stigma attached to the diagnosis can be almost as debilitating as the disorder itself.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

St Cuthbert&amp;#39;s Hospice helps around 80 local families each month, and for these people, the Hospice is a source of comfort, reassurance and strength. &amp;lt;p/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether this is by providing pain relief and symptom management, or by offering a peaceful place to stay and a range of activities, the emphasis at St. Cuthbert&amp;#39;s is on empowerment and making every day count. We operate a Day Hospice, a ten-bed In Patient Unit and a range of therapies and treatments. &amp;lt;p/&amp;gt;

providing quality, affordable housing and care services for older people
in Sussex.
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
SHC was formed in 1946 by a group of local residents working in senior
positions in health and housing - Major E F Holland, Mr Ronald Simson
and Dr Ashleigh Glegg. The supporters and employees of SHC still work
towards the association&amp;#39;s initial aim - to ensure &amp;#39;in old age there
should be security, and no-one in their latter years should find
themselves stranded, with nowhere to go , and no-one to befriend them.&amp;#39;
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
From these beginnings, SHC has extended and now offers a range of homes
and care for over 800 residents in a variety of locations in Sussex.
This has been achieved through the combined efforts of generous
benefactors and its committed staff and volunteers over the years.
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
This charitable status means that SHC relies on voluntary donations and
grants to provide extra welfare services to its residents that they
would otherwise not receive. In addition, shortfalls in funding from
local authorities for residential and nursing care are also met by SHC
through its welfare fund. Your donation will help us continue this
work, and help ensure we can provide the care and support services that
older people in Sussex deserve.</description><Point><coordinates>50.7699668536155,0.116187387112008</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Global Vision International Charitable Trust</name><description>Please note that the GVI-CT is separate from GVI and CANNOT be used as a fundraising tool to attend a GVI Program.

(as the PRA Benevolent Fund) to provide financial support for players
who have been forced to retire from the game due to serious injury or
illness, and support players&amp;#39; families in the event of their untimely
death. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Previous recipients include the Nick Duncombe Memorial Trust set up in
memory of the Harlequins &amp;amp; England scrum half who passed away in 2003,
Sale Sharks Andy Blyth, London Irish full back Jarrod Cunningham who
passed away in 2007 from Motor Neurones aged just 39, former England and
Bristol full back Alastair Hignell and, most notably, Leicester and
England&amp;#39;s U-21 prop Matt Hampson, who suffered a serious neck injury in
2005. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

As an increasing number of players suffer career ending injury, it is
imperative that the Benevolent Fund continues to grow. Through the
generous support of businesses, rugby supporters and the players
themselves, the RPA Benevolent Fund has been able to raise thousands of
pounds each year to help players and their families who are in need.</description><Point><coordinates>51.4489936094679,-0.328155276471367</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust Charity</name><description>The Charity turns over close to &amp;#163;1m each year as a result of the continued donations received from former patients and members from the local communities of Shropshire and Powys.

at a policy level to accelerate and improve the quality of reform in health, education and social protection services
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
at a practical level working directly with children, their families and their carers to facilitate their re-integration and to ensure their concerns are heard and addressed by policy makers
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
There are currently over 1 million children living in large residential institutions across Europe. Most of these children are not orphans but from ethnic minorities, poor backgrounds or are disabled. Published research proves that institutionalisation damages children&amp;#39;s health and development, and reduces their life chances. With experts in child protection, public health and social inclusion, and whose advice is sought by other concerned organisations, Lumos is able to effect real and lasting change.</description><Point><coordinates>51.5231204217104,-0.0987079140335535</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>enhance herts</name><description>enhance herts provides funding for extra state-of-the-art equipment, better facilities and new research to benefit hospital patients across East and North Hertfordshire, and the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, including the Lynda Jackson Macmillan Centre.</description><Point><coordinates>51.9237778271723,-0.210297743793598</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Cornwall Community Foundation</name><description>Cornwall Community Foundation is the charity committed to supporting local projects in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly that engage local people in making their communities better places to live.</description><Point><coordinates>50.6114581678826,-4.32962869655659</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Forever Angels Baby Home</name><description>Forever Angels Baby Home provides interim care for abandoned, orphaned and HIV positive children who have no one else to care for them.

&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
The Tag Rugby Trust is a rugby based charity that was formed in 2002. It exists to help improve the lives of children in some of the poorest regions of the world. We currently work with orphanages and government schools in India, Zambia, Uganda and Kenya using the game of Tag Rugby as our vehicle. We fund our tours through volunteers who pay to join the adventure and who work closely with the children in a coaching capacity. Almost without exception our volunteers say that the tour is a life changing experience for them.
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
We know that we make a difference to the lives, not only of the children we coach, but also the volunteers and friends of the Trust. We are passionate rugby people and we know the power it has to break down barriers and to create life long friendships. Above all, we believe that these positive experiences should be not only for the developed world but to growing “rugby nations” who don’t currently have the resources or opportunity to introduce children to the game. We provide that opportunity. In fact, taking this philosophy to the places we do to is arguably the most important ruby export that we can think of.Our values are many but in essence they revolve around these:
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
•Respect&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
•Teamwork&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
•Creating friendships&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
•Breaking down social &amp;amp; geographical barriers&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
•Co-operation between different communities&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;

Many people, especially in these days of economic recession, have reached a point where they cannot even feed themselves and their children. The foodbank network, now in over forty-five towns across the UK, meets this need, feeding over 35,000 people every year, and helping them to find hope and dignity. In London the foodbank network is working with Premier Radio&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Love London&amp;quot; campaign with the objective of setting up a foodbank in every Borough in London.

In our home town of Salisbury, in addition to running a busy foodbank,
we have many projects that provide work and job opportunities for
individuals with physical and mental difficulties. Our Re-Store charity
shop this year won the Charity Shop of the Year &amp;quot;best team&amp;quot; award,
reflecting the success of our work with supported volunteers.

The work of the charity started in Bulgaria, the poorest country in the
EU. Here we care for children and young people mainly from the Roma
community, the most marginalised group of people in Europe.
Projects include supporting an orphanage school and &amp;#39;The House of
Opportunity&amp;#39; residential training programme, which teaches life skills
and provides employment experience to vulnerable tengaging with communities and introducing sustainable projects that break through cycles of poverty.

Canterbury Cathedral Appeal.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Canterbury Cathedral is at the heart of the worldwide Anglican
Communion. It is the physical manifestation of a communion whose abiding
principles are tolerance, respect for others and a belief in a safer
and more sustainable world. We call this the Canterbury Gift. Canterbury
is a place of pilgrimage which each year gives renewed purpose to
hundreds of thousands of people of every faith and denomination. It is
also seen as special by many people of no faith at all.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

For the inheritance we all have at Canterbury to remain an inspiration
for the world we now need to undertake work to conserve the Cathedral -
it has after all been standing in the same place for at least one
thousand years. That great building, the physical embodiment of all we
stand for, need to develop it facilities to continue to ensure that
pilgrims and visitors feel welcome and engaged; it need to guarantee
the long term survival of the outstanding music and arts and crafts
skills. Canterbury Cathedral, this great physical and spiritual
institution, needs funding to stand and propagate its values for another
thousand years.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;


The Gift that Canterbury makes to the world is unique, timeless and
highly relevant. Will you help to sustain it for future generations?</description><Point><coordinates>51.2793314136514,1.08315493431225</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Baby Beat Appeal</name><description>A baby&amp;#39;s nine month journey in to the world is hazardous and the last few hours and minutes crucial to life.

We help seriously ill children in hospital.

We do this by giving them the best medicine they can get. A laugh.

Each week, we send a professional entertainer or artist into the wards to give the children a healing dose of fun.

We try our best to give them something to look forward to - like arranging a post-treatment VIP trip to Hamleys.

In all this, our aim is to help the children forget where they are, forget the suffering and forget the monotony of hospitalisation. 

If we can achieve any of that, even for a second, it’s all worth it.

We already help the kids in the Carousel Ward of UCH in London. 

Now we need your help to get to the hundreds of children in 21 similar wards nationwide.

Every penny you can spare will go directly into bringing some much-needed fun and laughter to all of them.

For some people with HIV, independence may mean staying healthy with the minimum of support. For others, it may mean learning new skills or living their life without fear of stigma within the community. Whatever their aims, we listen to &amp;amp; work with each individual to ensure that their lives are as fulfilling as possible.

It welcomed its first intake of 187 students in September 2007 and by 2013 it will cater for 1,150 students, including a sixth form for 250 students. UBS is the leading city financial firm which has helped to support and establish the school which specialises in Music and Mathematics.  

Hackney is one of the most deprived areas in the UK - unemployment is at 16% which is double the London average and 3 times the UK average. 82% of the population live in social housing and 47% of all residential lettings are in receipt of Housing Benefit. Approximately 50% of pupils in Hackney are eligible for free school meals (an indicator of poverty on the deprivation index) compared to a national average of about 20%. Despite its proximity to the City, 30% of school leavers never get a job. 

Through the Bridge Academy partnership UBS seeks not only to develop a lifelong enthusiasm for learning among students, but also to support regeneration in the area.

distribution project which will benefit 3,500 children and 2,500 pregnant
women living in the Bugarika squatter settlement in Mwanza. The
protection provided by one insecticide-treated bed net, costing &amp;#163;4, can save
the lives of two children or prevent one women from miscarrying or giving

The Nginn Karet Foundation for Cambodia exists in order to help village people in Cambodia to secure their basic needs, through a partnership program. Focusing initially on one village, the Foundation supports village people to secure their basic needs, including primary education. Primary health care systems are supported so as to enable mothers to produce appropriate food for their families, based on locally grown cereals, vegetables, fruit and fish. The provision of potable water and the control of local water supplies to village fields for crop and livestock production is a priority. Ownership of the program lies with the village people. The Foundation respects and tries to promote the traditional culture on which village life is based, within the context of sustainable development for basic needs.</description><Point><coordinates>51.7888404520134,-1.27209084002641</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Kenyan Orphan Project</name><description>Kenyan Orphan project is an organisation to help the people of western Kenya in the fight against poverty and disease.

fly2help lifts the horizons of people of all ages, backgrounds and cultures through the medium of flight. We support those with life-limiting and chronic illnesses; families who have suffered some form of tragedy and those who are working to recover a sense of self-worth and need a life-boost.  This includes those struggling to live with bereavement and disability, isolation or poverty and people who have suffered extreme neglect and abuse.
An exhilarating flight gives our beneficiaries the chance to see the world from a new perspective leaving their worries on the ground.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;






The people with whom we work come from various backgrounds and face disadvantage in a variety of forms: social, economic, physical, educational and cultural.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Many are from areas of social deprivation, both urban and rural. They may be from troubled family backgrounds, and that includes those who are or have been in care or are victims of abuse. Some have emotional or behavioural problems, others live with learning difficulties and special educational needs. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
By giving these people the opportunity to experience the liberation and freedom of flight, our team hopes to inspire and develop their imagination and to enhance their self-determination. The extra boost that comes from the freedom of the skies and the exhilaration of flight renews motivation, enthuses and increases long term self esteem and confidence.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

the ground-breaking multi-agency response to domestic violence. Standing
Together influences national policy and practice by initiating and driving
innovation, providing safer options for women and their children and holding
perpetrators accountable. Standing Together builds and supports effective
multi agency partnerships throughout the UK to meet the needs of survivors
of domestic violence.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Standing Together believes that that domestic violence is a serious and high
volume crime which no one agency can deal with effectively if acting alone.
It destroys families and damages society. The facts about domestic violence
are shocking and all communities, classes and ages are affected. 1 in 4
women experience domestic violence. Two women are murdered in the UK by
their current or former partner every week.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Standing Together trains all agencies to deal with domestic violence
effectively and consults with survivors to inform improvements in services.</description><Point><coordinates>51.4930129742605,-0.235851752569413</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>CAMEO-Aid</name><description>CAMEO-Aid delivers medical and educational aid to the poor in the third world.

Baan Romjit is a small charity set up by Noi and Arlene Ramasut in the wake of the Tsunami . The aim of the project is to help children troubled by natural disasters and displacement. 

The first project undertaken by the charity was to support children in the Khao Luk area of southern Thailand most devastated by the tsunami.
Baan Romjit provided funds for Ajarn ( Professor) Beow and her team of volunteers to seek out children in the more remote villages who had been traumatised by the loss of  parents, close family and their homes  Through 
regular visits ,small group counselling and therapeutic games, the children were gradually enabled to come to terms with what had happened and begin to look to the future. Baan Romjit provided small playgrounds for each of the four rural schools and also assisted in improving the toilet and washing facilities.

Baan Romjit is now committed to helping displaced children from Burma
in the Mae Sot area on the Thai- Burma border. Baan Romjit has provided funds for one small migrant school to repair the thatched roof before the rainy season and is now supporting the building of a brand new school to replace the old buildings.

This grew over the years into the Northampton Soup Kitchen and finally developed in the Hope Centre, a Day Centre offering a wide range of services and practical support to Northampton’s homeless. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

35 years later, we are still offering life’s basics such as hot meals, showers and clothes.  We now also offer a range of life skills workshops and activities to improve our clients self esteem and enable them to move on.  Our client group include the street homeless and vulnerably housed along with those who are settled but have ongoing complex needs including drug, alcohol and mental health issues. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

We offer practical support, friendship and a sense of community.  Without the Hope Centre, many of our clients would have no-where to turn and no hope of improving their future.  We see approximately 60 clients each day and it costs &amp;#163;12,500 each month just to keep our doors open. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

We are a small friendly charity that relies heavily on the generosity of local people, churches, schools and businesses.  Thanks for looking at our Just Giving page and thank you for your support – it makes a huge difference to the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in Northampton.</description><Point><coordinates>52.2448568396236,-0.896697059069002</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Joint Aid Management</name><description>JAM (Joint Aid Management) is a Christian non-profit non-government humanitarian relief organisation, actively assisting African countries to develop.JAM focus on: Nutritional feeding-Assistance to orphans and vulnerable children-Provision of water sanitation-Skill development and community training-Agricultural development.

It was established in 1904 and has a world wide reputation for the quality of its training.  RADA has a broad selection policy.  It runs an ongoing fundraising appeal to Trusts, Foundations and philanthropic individuals in order to provide awards for those students who need additional financial assistance in order to complete the training on the full time courses. 
The contact time at RADA is high.  Students work in excess of 36 hours per week which precludes their undertaking regular part time employment to supplement their income during term time.  Students who are relocating to London for the first time are in a particularly vulnerable financial position as the full student loan does not cover the real costs of living in London.  So too are students with a first degree who are ineligible for loans to pay the mandatory student fee or their term time living costs.

All donations made to the Student Scholarship/Bursary funds at RADA are allocated to students in genuine financial need.  By making a donation to RADA you are supporting the stars of tomorrow, today!

The Melissa Nathan Foundation was founded to provide financial support
for families that are in crisis.

Melissa would frequently do this herself without ever telling anyone
about it. The stories of her kindness and generosity in helping families
in their moments of need have only emerged since she died.

Our wish is to continue to help families in Melissa&amp;#39;s name.

The families might be struggling to cope with illness, incapacity,
poverty or other domestic crisis. Whatever the cause, we want to help
deal with the consequences.

conservation – in a country with the world’s third highest population growth

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Working with the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), UCF aims to sensitise
communities and demonstrate through practical projects how people can gain
financial benefits from conservation.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
UCF’s current challenge is assisting UWA in the recovery of the 400km&amp;#178; Dura
sector north of Lake George, where wildlife has literally been wiped out by
poaching. The Dura project is an extension of the successful Waterways
project, which is combating ivory poaching, bushmeat smoking, live animal
trafficking and illegal fishing across Lakes Edward, George and Albert.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Other successful projects include measures to reduce elephant crop raiding.
Since the excavation of 30km trenches and erection of 13 elephant fences no
retaliatory killings of elephants have been reported. Farmers are now
harvesting their crops, allowing children to attend secondary school rather
than guard crops, proving that simple low-tech solutions can make a massive
difference to rural communities’ quality of life.

Our members carry out simple repairs through to complete engine rebuilds, and maintain our fleet of motorbikes that are used during off road riding trips.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

We also teach cooking and photography, and arrange trips to motorsport events such as the Weston Beach Race and British Motocross Grand Prix, so that our members can watch their sporting heroes in action. Through all of these activities, we equip young people with both qualifications and life skills to help them lead meaningful futures.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

We&amp;#39;re currently hoping to raise &amp;#163;10,000 towards a camping and off-road motorbike riding residential trip for our young members. To find out more visit http://www.justgiving.com/Archway-Project-Residential-Appeal-2010/

Wellesley, aged one, was diagnosed with Rett Syndrome.  Not being aware of the existence of this condition at the
time, the horrific days and weeks that followed we, her family, discovered what it
means to us and to about 2,000 other families in the UK.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Rett Syndrome is caused by a sporadic genetic mutation
on the MECP2
gene located on the X chromosome.
This microscopic change in the structure of chromosomal proteins has an
overwhelming impact on the life of the 1 girl in 15,000 statistically around
the world.  Most obviously, Rett chronically
slows these girls neuro-development, very few Rett girls will ever speak and
only half of them will walk. Behind the physical incapacity, there are also
additional problems as Rett girls are prone to scoliosis, difficulties with
digestion, epilepsy and fits of extreme anxiety.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;



We set up the charity to fund research into finding a cure for Rett.
There has been very significant progress towards that goal over the
last four years and I&amp;#39;m pleased to say that Professor Adrian Bird at
Edinburgh University is at the forefront. Research can be very focused
as the gene, MEPC2, that causes Rett was pinpointed ten years ago.
Finding a cure for Rett would bring so much happiness to many girls who
are prisoners within their own bodies, plus it will help to find a cure
for other genetically related disorders. Thank you</description><Point><coordinates>51.3834392411083,-2.36248859136708</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Cadasil Research &amp; Support Trust</name><description>Purpose and activities: To raise CADASIL awareness; to provide sufferers and their families with crucial support; to serve as an important interface between specialist neurological practitioners/researchers, GPs and sufferers; to research into therapeutic technologies and other treatments; and to co-ordinate with other charities representing various degenerative neurological conditions.</description><Point><coordinates>55.3148732604474,-1.95800535029138</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>The Kilworth Challenge</name><description>It supports charities/organisations/individuals, whose primarily focus is providing sporting/recreational activities for individuals with special needs by reason of age, infirmity or disability, to improve their conditions of life and also locally in areas of social welfare, education, leisure and the protection/development of the environment.</description><Point><coordinates>52.4455655539111,-1.08967986091198</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Cardiac Rehab Support</name><description>It fundraises to provide servces for local cardiac patients in the form of exercise classes, a buddy service and it works with another local group to assist in providing social events.</description><Point><coordinates>50.840078847983,-0.268136643308087</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Cardiac Rehab Support</name><description>It fundraises to provide servces for local cardiac patients in the form of exercise classes, a buddy service and it works with another local group to assist in providing social events.</description><Point><coordinates>50.9230066549253,-0.447177089611392</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>St Clare's Foundation</name><description>It works with Sisters helping Aids orphans in Kenya, providing food, shelter and education.

We provide long term, effective, sustainable support to 30 physically disabled children at the New Life Centre in Nepal and with virtually no administrative costs. The children usually come from remote and mountainous areas where life for a disabled child is particularly difficult and there is very little medical help or access to education. Disability may occur due to a variety of reasons but often because of untreated accidental injuries and severe burn injuries as a result of babies and young children being left unattended with open cooking fires while their parents work the land.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
We work closely with the children and staff at the centre assessing their needs and liaising with the local board members of the centre about the best way we can help. The main focus of our support is a commitment to provide a new home which will help the centre save a third of its budget for rent to use for other important expenses. We also help with other essential day to day costs. We liaise with other Nepali and foreign donors of the centre to ensure a web of integrated support that minimises reliance on any one agency alone, thus guaranteeing on going medical care, a caring home, a healthy diet, good education, as well as post school training and further study where appropriate.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;</description><Point><coordinates>51.3767943930873,-2.55709772731523</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Pernicious Anaemia Society</name><description>We provide Information, Advice and Support for sufferers of Pernicious Anaemia and B12 Deficiency and their families and friends.</description><Point><coordinates>51.5408677157653,-3.59249871684309</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>FOPSA</name><description>Friends of the Priory School (FOPSA) is a voluntary group of parents and teachers who raise money to support the school both financially and to build community.</description><Point><coordinates>51.4244519910451,-0.19021515747131</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>FOPSA</name><description>Friends of the Priory School (FOPSA) is a voluntary group of parents and teachers who raise money to support the school both financially and to build community.</description><Point><coordinates>51.426413404121,-0.191432428073653</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Just 1 Life</name><description>Just 1 Life is a charitable organisation dedicated to raising lifesaving funds for premature baby units across the UK.

many years experience of living and working in London. Our guiding
vision was, and remains, a modern, urban Steiner school that addresses
the needs of children who are growing up in this city. We want our
children to feel part of the community, not that they are living in a
sheltered oasis. The cosmopolitan nature of life in London brings the
children into daily contact with people from many different backgrounds,
so that the need for interest in and understanding for others is not
just taught but experienced. By nurturing in the children a deep respect
for all human beings and an enthusiastic and active interest in the
world, we aim to help them orientate themselves towards whatever comes
to meet them in life, while they are growing and when they are adults.

The school is fast outgrowing its current shared premises with another
school with about 90 children aged between 3 and 13. To keep the school
accessible to as many members of the community their fees are kept low
just to cover day to day expenditures. Funds for capital expenditure are
required in the immediate future for a new premises to accommodate the
school&amp;#39;s expansion.</description><Point><coordinates>51.4550695948159,-0.197440010547392</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Camelon Parish Church</name><description>The Church of Scotland exists to glorify God and to work for the advancement of Christ&amp;#39;s kingdom throughout the world.

The ICR&amp;#39;s unique partnership with The Royal Marsden Hospital forms Europe&amp;#39;s largest cancer research centre and ensures that discoveries made in the ICR&amp;#39;s laboratories are swiftly translated into treatment and care for those affected by cancer.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

The Institute of Cancer Research has been leading the way in the fight against cancer for a hundred years and we are making some truly exciting breakthroughs.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

It was the ICR that first noticed the suspected link between smoking and cancer.  It was the ICR that first recognized that all cancers are genetic.  It is the ICR that is now identifying hundreds of genes that contribute to the development of cancer.  And it is the ICR that is developing new drugs to target the genetic causes of many different types of cancer.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Having been responsible for some of the greatest achievements in the history of cancer research, the ICR’s world-leading scientists work tirelessly to continue making progress in the ongoing fight against cancer, but they need your help now, and in the future, to realise their ultimate goal: to see an end to cancer as a life threatening disease.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

provides information and support to families and professionals caring for
individuals with severe learning disabilities, who are described as having
challenging behaviour.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CBF was founded twelve years ago by a parent carer Vivien Cooper: &amp;quot;When our son Daniel was diagnosed with Cri du Chat Syndrome, the only information
given was a single sheet of paper. This wasn&amp;#39;t much help when Daniel
was pulling the curtains down, ripping his mattress open and eating the
stuffing, or banging his head. With specialist help, children like Daniel
can learn ways to communicate that mean they don&amp;#39;t need to resort to
challenging behaviour. Frustrated that this specialist understanding had not
reached us sooner when we needed it, I set up the foundation in order to
provide information and support to other families caring for individuals
with severe learning disabilities&amp;quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CBF provides a range of resources on issues surrounding challenging behaviour and actively campaigns at national policy level. Resources are
free to parent carers.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Our aim is for children and adults with severe learning disabilities,
who are described as having challenging behaviour, having the same life
opportunities as everyone else, including home life, education, employment
and leisure&amp;quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For more information visit our website:&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

those impacting on disadvantaged and vulnerable people, integral to the
practice and teaching of architecture.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Our motivation for establishing ASF stems from an ambition to make
architectural practice more relevant to the majority of the world’s
population who are living in marginalised or poverty situations (both in the
UK and worldwide). At architecture school students are taught to provide
solutions to complex issues, however, often people in communities benefit
more from being involved in the process of development than by being
disempowered recipients of more often inappropriate solutions. It was these
frustrations that lead a small team of dedicated volunteers to create ASF
and in doing so establish an organisation that supports architectural
education by teaching (and working with) the essential participatory tools
and techniques required when working as a professional in community or
international development projects.</description><Point><coordinates>51.7478507032499,-1.23757554785146</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>The Juniper Trust</name><description>The Juniper Trust began by supporting small sustainable projects in Nepal to help the poorest communities and particularly children.

However, the people of the Caribbean require more than this to allow them a minimal standard of living. In reality they are often without the basic necessities that we take for granted, for example - running water, electricity, clothes etc. In many cases the young of the Islands are unable to obtain good educational and reading books, adequate clothing and shoes, bedding for babies and young children and educational toys that will help them grow into strong adults with the necessary abilities to help them achieve a better future for their own families.

The objectives at CAMDY are to help and support these youngsters, by providing these valuable items for some children in the Caribbean. The most beneficial way of achieving this is by forwarding via air freight a range of good quality donated items from the UK. Additionally this has proved an effective action to help minimise landfill sites in the Britain by reducing waste.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

needs of those at risk and EAF seeks to go further, combating the causes
of homelessness as well as helping those who are already suffering.
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
Acting as an umbrella organisation, EAF donates money to existing
charities nationwide who help people like Stuart, medically discharged
from the Army and told he isn&amp;#39;t a priority for a council house or
Nicola, raised in Local Authority Care but with nowhere to go once she
reached the age of 16 or Sheila who was discharged from hospital
suffering from mental illness with no care package or support system in
place.
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
Those at risk of becoming homeless are amongst society&amp;#39;s most vulnerable
people and with all funds donated to EAF going directly to help good
causes, your support can make a real difference.</description><Point><coordinates>51.2897046687408,-0.315315607540192</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Mullion Gymnastics Charity Cycle Ride</name><description>Mullion Gymnastics Centre has been set up to encourage young children in sport, to help recognise gifted and talented children.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
In the area covered by Project Luangwa there are over 20 schools, ranging from pre-school to Secondary. A few already receive support and will continue to do so but we will also seek to widen the net to include the neglected schools as well. None of the unsupported schools have enough classrooms and the ones they have are in a poor state of repair. Often classes may have up to 100 children sitting on the floor; there are few desks, and an average of one text book for every seven children. Because of the lack of space and teachers these children will only attend for a half day. We are also raising funds for a proposed vocational training centre in Mfuwe. From 2011 we will support the micro-financing of small businesses.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Approximately 23% of Mfuwe children are orphans. These vulnerable children are usually taken in by relatives who often can hardly afford to feed them let alone provide school fees, uniform and books. Some of these children have been lucky enough to find sponsors through Project Luangwa and our Kawaza project who contribute to these annual costs.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Project Luangwa is a registered Charity in the UK, USA and Zambia.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

And, following in their footsteps, hundreds of thousands of people, right across the UK, have a great time when they complete brilliant challenges of their own.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The Sport Relief Weekend is taking place from Friday 19th March to Sunday 21st March 2010 and it’ll be three whole days of energy, entertainment and events for everyone to enjoy.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Our projects aim to facilitate parents &amp;amp; others to consider children’s needs first &amp;amp;  to enable their voices to be heard.  We’re committed to meeting the needs of these children in a variety of ways.  Over 35% of children are affected by family breakdown by the age of 16. The adversarial system often escalates conflict between parents, which can be damaging for children. Parenting is never an easy task:  it’s even more complicated &amp;amp; delicate when you don’t live with the other parent &amp;amp; emotions are raw.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Mediation works to enable families to manage these difficult situations in the most helpful way for all.  It helps parents keep the conversations on track, slowing it down to make sure they have all the information they need, have heard how each other see the issues, &amp;amp; weigh the pros and cons of different options.  By protecting parents from pressure/judgement we successfully provide space for them to find solutions in a creative way.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Around 19,000 children have benefited directly from our Mediation Service &amp;amp; Children’s Service, with many children benefiting directly or indirectly from our Schools Training Programme, our Walking on Eggshells Project for school students &amp;amp; our Parenting Apart Workshops.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
OFM is a professional service:  all mediators are highly experienced, qualified, trained &amp;amp; accredited by the Legal Services Commission.</description><Point><coordinates>51.7600431948092,-1.20883764661995</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Lough Neagh Rescue</name><description>Lough Neagh is the largest lake in the British Isles.

The areas we work in have very high numbers of lone-parents struggling to bring up a family, and unfortunately there are also very high instances of domestic violence, frequently witnessed by children.  Our service is engaged either by other groups supporting the family, the child’s school or the family themselves.  We offer a confidential, non judgmental, clinical assessment of the family’s needs, followed by a program of counselling for any members of the family who want and will benefit from it. We often see kids by themselves, but can see them in small groups, or as a family unit.
What we do is very effective, and the benefits stay with the family for many years to come.
Not all families are covered by the funding streams we have, because they attend the wrong school or have the wrong postcode, and money raised from sponsored events enables us to see some families that would otherwise fall through the net.

In the last 20 years, polio has declined by 99%. In 1988, 350,000 people got polio, but by 2008, the number was down to just 2,000. We are on the brink
of eradicating Polio from the world. The Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation have given us the opportunity to reach our goal by offering a $355m grant
which Rotary has to match within three years. We need to raise &amp;#163;900 a year for 3 years to achieve this goal and with your help The Rotary Club of
Dorchester can do it. The countries where the Polio virus is still active are India, Pakistan and places in Africa (e.g. Nigeria). With world travel,
these days Polo is only a sneeze away.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
In developing countries, after children are immunised, they dip their little ‘pinkie’ finger in a purple dye so there’s no risk of being vaccinated
twice! It only costs 40p to immunise a child.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The Rotary Club of Dorchester is visiting local schools to tell them about the &amp;#39;End Polio Now&amp;#39; campaign and to promote the Purple Pinkie Project.

effective economic and social policies by understanding better their
impact on individuals, families, businesses and the government&amp;#39;s finances.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Research findings are based on rigorous analysis, detailed empirical
evidence and in-depth institutional knowledge. The Institute seeks to
communicate them effectively, to a wide range of audiences, thereby
maximising their impact on policy both directly and by informing public
debate.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
IFS is independent of all political parties and other vested interests
and is established as Britain&amp;#39;s leading independent microeconomic
research institute, and as an authoritative commentator on the public
finances, tax and welfare policy, tax law, education, inequality and
poverty, pensions, productivity and innovation, consumer behaviour and
the evaluation of policies designed to promote development in poorer
countries.
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
IFS has a hard-won reputation for objectivity and impartiality. This is
reflected in the way the Institute is funded. As a charity it welcomes
support from charitable foundations, and public and private bodies, to
help fund particular pieces of research. The Institute also relies
crucially on core funding from the Economic and Social Research Council

The Trust has launched an ambitious campaign to raise &amp;#163;10 million to restore and conserve the house for current and future generations.  This will include a new visitor centre and education suite, providing much needed interpretation on the life and works of Sir Walter Scott, including the themes of reconciliation and national identity, so prevalent in his novels and poems and of huge relevance to the world today.  Abbotsford is one of the earliest examples of Scottish Baronial architecture, a style that led to gothic revivalism and some of the most iconic buildings in our towns and cities, so closely associated with the Victorian era.  This combined with the important legacy that Scott left us, means that if we fail to save Abbotsford, it will be a tragedy for Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world.</description><Point><coordinates>55.5995522003517,-2.7806127782099</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Scottish Wildlife Trust</name><description>Formed in 1964, the Scottish Wildlife Trust is a charity with the objective to “advance the conservation of Scotland’s biodiversity for the benefit of present and future generations.” </description><Point><coordinates>55.9788766734111,-3.29671552657325</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Scottish Wildcat Association</name><description>The Scottish Wildcat Association is dedicated to conserving the wildcat; less than 400 remain, threatened by hybridisation with ferals and roadkills.

Pocklington School has been on the same site near York since it was founded in 1514 by lawyer and clergyman John Dolman, for whom the Trust is named.
The Foundation is a supportive and caring community rooted in the values of truth, courage and trust. Our approach to learning and development is shaped around the spiritual and physical well-being of each child we educate. We nurture each individual’s potential in a culture that encourages successful learning and creative thinking while rewarding initiative and independence.
Our aim is to give pupils the support and freedom they need to flourish into balanced, fully-rounded and confident adults who are inspired for life. By making a gift to The John Dolman Trust you will help us to continue to achieve this. Thank you for your support.

Locally we support numerous charities including The Rockford Trust, East Anglian Childrens Hospice, CLIC/Sargent. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Our club has informal but strong links with Rotary in Madeira and the Flood Disaster in February in Funchal prompted us to set up this JustGiving page with a specific endeavour to help to raise money for the victims who have suffered a major loss and have no insurance or other means of financial help.

It now has three sections: Beaver Scouts (6 to 8 years); Cub Scouts (8 to 10&amp;#189; years) and Scouts (10&amp;#189; to 14 years).We hope to have an Explorer Scout Unit (14 to18 years) in the near future. In the last few years our numbers have grown from 41 to 61. This includes ten adult, volunteer leaders. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our membership, including both boys and girls, join in weekly meetings and additional indoor and outdoor evening or weekend activities. Camping is still a major part of scouting, encouraging young people to be self reliant and to lead others. The Group has been looking at additional activities to offer to our scouts and perhaps others in the community. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first new activity is Archer and we have purchased over &amp;#163;2,500 worth of equipment. We have one trained instructor and will be training more this year. With a growing Scout Group we need to provide an attractive and versatile facility as an activity and training base for young people from six to eighteen. We also need to attract the adult volunteer leadership on which Scouting is based.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The HQ will not be for the exclusive use of our Scout Group. There is a lack of small meeting venues in Halesworth and the new Scout HQ will be a new and attractive meeting place for others in the town. Currently the present HQ is used by Yoga classes and has also supported Street Parties and will be used by the High Tide festival this year.</description><Point><coordinates>52.3591455391733,1.48082916282697</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>SMILES</name><description>SMILES stands for Slimmers Making It a Little Easier for Someone, and each year the SMILES committee chooses a special charity to benefit from the amazing generosity of Slimming World Consultants’ and members’.

The Parikrma Model includes:

a) A 360 degree development program built around the life of a child and covers top-class English Education, Nutrition (3 meals a day), comprehensive Healthcare and Family Care. We call this the Circle of Life.
b) An end-to-end program (e2e) - where the entire education from school to college for a child is looked after by Parikrma. This is what increases the probability of success. Parikrma will directly manage the imparting of education from KG to 12. After that Parikrma will provide scholarships and other options for children to go through professional college / vocational training before placing the children in jobs.
Please see www.parikrmafoundation.org for detailed information on the organisation and its work.</description><Point><coordinates>55.8524545004334,-4.5761703865368</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Dunfermline Rugby Club Roof Fund</name><description>The purpose of this charity is to develop youth development and facilities at Dunfermline Rugby Club</description><Point><coordinates>56.0529510507317,-3.41391033786474</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Cocowai Trust</name><description>To help and improve the lives and living standards of homeless elderly people in Nepal.

Rotary is an organisation that has been around for over 100 years. Interestingly it is not a British institution but in fact originated in America and is now International.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
It&amp;#39;s primary function is to help others, it&amp;#39;s motto is &amp;quot;service above self&amp;quot; and like most mottos sets very high ideals, however we do raise money for local and international appeals as well as help people reach their potential.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
If you like to help others then you will find many of a similar mind in Rotary and I am sure you will make strong friendships, in fact one of the best rewards for our work is the fellowship and friendship that you get from other members.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Building works at St Michael’s&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Our problem&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
One of our classrooms was very small and could only accommodate 18 children. Our new infant school will have 3 classes of 25 children so this very small classroom needed to be extended.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The school office space was very much too small and did not meet health and safety requirements.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The solution&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Extend the small classroom into space that was part of the entrance to the school and had accommodated aspects of the office equipment especially the photo copier, as well as a place for children who felt unwell etc.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Build a new entrance and office facility that includes enough room for 2 members of staff, a space for unwell children, a reprographics area, a disabled w.c.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The funding&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
As a church school the largest share of the cost has been met by the diocese.&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;
The governors are required to find 10% of the cost. Most of this 10% has been donated by a local benefactor but there is a slight shortfall that we need to cover by fundraising&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The Friends of St Michael’s are looking to raise sufficient funds to cover the shortfall for this project.  Please sponsor a St Michael’s pupil to walk up Box Hill, or make a donation in support of your local school.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;</description><Point><coordinates>51.269883291283,-0.318492365174139</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Eastbourne Round Table</name><description>Eastbourne Round Table makes a real difference to its local community by raising funds for local charities and other good causes.

All funds raised from out Sponsored Events will go directly towards the development of our Sports and Leisure Complex on the Docklands Campus, due for completion in 2011, ready just in time for the Team USA to use it as their base for the 2012 Olympics. This is a very exciting year for the University. We are all very excited about these events and hope that you will want to take part.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

One of London’s most respected and best loved theatres. Producing challenging and innovative theatre, cinema and visual arts, and an extensive education programme.

“There is no theatre in Britain that punches so consistently above its weight as the Tricycle in Kilburn, It may be small but big things happen there” The Daily Telegraph 2009

“Kilburn’s political powerhouse the Tricycle, the natural home of docu-drama” Time Out

“The Tricycle continues to place itself truly on the global theatrical map”.  The Times

“…for the past 25 years, the small but influential Tricycle has not only altered the landscape of British theatre but has also helped change how the Establishment operates”.  Financial Times


How you can help

Like many arts organisations, the Tricycle constantly struggles to make ends meet. Income from performances and grants covers 85% of its costs, which means it relies on donations and sponsorship to make up the shortfall, typically in excess of &amp;#163;400,000 annually.

Aids and poverty.

Friends of Ebenezer Child Care support ECCT (Ebenezer Child Care Trust) in
Livingstone, Zambia, where a team of dedicated Christians are transforming
the lives of children who had no hope of an education or a future.

Orphaned children who do not have another relative to care for them are able
to live in one of the Ebenezer houses with a housemother.

Every penny raised goes directly to this project which has a long term
commitment to ensure that each child can complete their education as far as
they are able. It costs &amp;#163;12.50 per child per month to provide food, clothes
and an education.

An exciting development during the last year has been the purchase of a
farm. This is now up and running and is helping to feed over 300 children
who are supported by this amazing work. Hopefully it will eventually produce
a surplus which can raise an income.

Ebenezer believes that every child deserves to have a place to call home
and someone to call mother.

Phunzira is a 100% not-for-profit charity that is raising funds to build a self-sustainable education centre for impoverished children and adults in the north of Malawi.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The centre will be located in Ruarwe, a small fishing village that likes along the shores of Lake Malawi, and will be accessible free of charge to four surrounding communities.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
We will provide access to educational materials, as well as tuition classes for students and life skills classes for adults. Through the sale of crops, the centre will be financially self-sustainable within 2 to 5 years of construction.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
All money raised through sponsorship and fundraising events will be used towards building and maintaining this centre; none will be taken for administration or any other purpose.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

The idea was to create a simple structure that would enable young people to use their centres of influence to learn, understand and then make a difference in other people&amp;#39;s lives in South Africa. We wanted to show our friends how easy it was to make a significant impact.

The JDI ethos shies away from the idea of making nameless donations to organisations where you can’t see how you money is spent, or from encouraging dependency by giving cash to individuals who are sometimes unable to spend it properly. Instead members are encouraged to ‘See. Think. Do’.

Here in the UK - JDI London is a group of friends  who love South Africa and hate seeing any suffering there. We commit a small piece of our lives (e.g. time/ skills/ money/ contacts) to worthwhile and effective projects in SA with which we have close ties.

Two of the projects we support are Children of the Dawn and Mthimkhulu Centre. Children of the Dawn empowers and strengthens existing community initiatives which focus on caring for HIV/AIDS orphans in rural South Africa. Based on a sponsorship programme, Children of the Dawn&amp;#39;s goal is to give back a future to these affected children. Mthimhkulu is a day care centre for disabled children in Soweto run by Sam and Leah Kunene. It&amp;#39;s an oasis of desperately needed care and development in an area where many disabled children are neglected due to stigmas, lack of understanding or resources.</description><Point><coordinates>51.4614566777278,-0.161641044275761</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Islay &amp; Jura Sick Children's Fund</name><description>Provision of travel and accommodation expenses for families resident on Islay and Jura who have children hospitalised on the mainland.</description><Point><coordinates>55.7628828081975,-6.26432348730957</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>TLC UK</name><description>It raises money to support the work of The Love of Christ Ministries, a children&amp;#39;s home in South Africa that seeks to find permanent loving families for the orphaned and abandoned babies of Johannesburg infected or affected by the HIV/AIDs crisis.</description><Point><coordinates>52.4137004371057,-1.9397141823839</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>TLC UK</name><description>It raises money to support the work of The Love of Christ Ministries, a children&amp;#39;s home in South Africa that seeks to find permanent loving families for the orphaned and abandoned babies of Johannesburg infected or affected by the HIV/AIDs crisis.</description><Point><coordinates>52.4174525619083,-1.9286508249602</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>ADAP</name><description>TBC</description><Point><coordinates>51.5548798582002,0.0142684711604305</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Barnes Rugby Club</name><description>Barnes Rugby Club is a thriving local amateur London rugby club serving the local community with 5 mens teams, a ladies XV and 100&amp;#39;s of boys and girls playing mini rugby too.</description><Point><coordinates>51.4758088,-0.2303232</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><name>Butterfly Conservation </name><description>Butterfly Conservation is the largest insect conservation charity in Europe.
